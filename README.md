# Synopsis
Temples (templ*at*es that you won't hate) is the most easy to use templating system for HTML.
Temples is a declarative DOM-based rendering engine, depending on jQuery, that have a special ability for real-time/partial updates.
Temples are just plain old HTML pages blocks or fragments with special `data-bind attributes`
Temples work inside the browser or with your all-time favorite [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) environment.

# Motivations

I want a template system that :

- is easy to use, easy to read and predicable in its syntax.
- won't break my pages with ugly non-HTML syntax that isn't recognized by my IDE.
- is reliable. So that i can give my pages back to web designers so that they work on the markups, css, and they have very little chances to break it.
- can support real-time live updates of only the relevant data (without rendering the whole thing).
- is able to work seamlessly with structured data with any levels of sub-elements.

I want to :
- use genuine HTML pages, full with example text, and transform them with just the addition of a few `data-bind attributes.
- understand how it works in 2 minutes.

# Status

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/zipang/temples.png)](http://travis-ci.org/zipang/temples)

# Features

- Fully HTML5 compliant. Won't break your pages.
- Declarative bindings.
- Sub-templates use the same syntax to render the complexity of structured data.
- Can be used in Node.JS (with a special Jquery lite module) for server-side template rendering.

# Installation
There are a few ways to use `temples`.

##In the browser :
Just include the `temples.js` script after jQuery.

```html
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="my/path/to/temples.js"></script>
```

##With node.js :
Install the library using npm or add it to your `package.json` file as a dependancy,
then, simply do

```js
var Temples = require("Temples");
```


# Usage

## Template registration
To re-use being able to use it, `temples` will try to match the key in the data to an `id` in the
tag, since both should be unique.

```html
<div id="logged-user">
    <span data-bind="firstname">John<span> <span data-bind="lastname">DOE<span> was here.
</div>
```

```js
var Temples = require('Temples');

Temples.register("logged-user", "#logged-user");
Temples.render("logged-user", { "firstname": "James", "lastname": "Wood" });

```

## Explicit constructions
Another way is to build the template's renderer and to keep an handle on it for later re-use and disposal.

```js
var myPage = new Temples.Renderer(window.document);

// Use the provided data to render the full page
myPage.render({ some: "data", more: "to come", ... });

// update just an element in the page
myPage.update({ "some": "new value" });

// later..
myPage.destroy();
```



## Collections

Temples can easily iterate over collections and build a list of items, with a special `data-iterate` attribute that will design the collection,
and will use the first level sub-template to render the child elements :

```html
<ul id="tags" data-iterate="article.tags">
    <li><a data-bind="tag.label, href=tag.url" >war</a></li>
    <li><a href="#war">war</a></li><!-- This second list item is an example that will not be used to render the template -->
</ul>
```

```js

var dataPresenter = {
    article : {
        title: "Why did Steve Job leave the train ?",
        tags: ["lolcats", "steve sander"],
        // ...
    }
];

Temples.update("article", dataPresenter);

```


# API

## Temples Static Methods

```
function Temples.register(name, template)
@param name {String} A string of well-formed HTML.
@param template {String} The DOM id, path, or content of an HTML template.

@return {Renderer} A compiled template, ready to use to render data.
```

```
function Temples.render(name, data)
@param name {String} The name of a registered template.
@param data {Object} The strutured data to render.

@return {DOMElement} the updated template DOM, to allow insertion, clone, or serialization.
```

## Renderer Constructor

```
function Temples.Renderer(template)
@options {String} The DOM id, path, or content of an HTML template.
  - @option where {String} The default attribute to match on instead of ID.
  - @option as {String} The default attribute to replace into.
@return {Object} An object that represents a reusable map, has mapping methods.
```

## Renderer Instance Methods

### render()

```
function Renderer#render(data)
@param data {Object} The strutured data to render..

This method will update all binded elements with the values found (or not found) in the provided data.
Therefore, the lack of data for a binded element will resume in a blank ('') rendering.
```

### update()

```
function Renderer#update(expr, ...)
@param [expr] {Object} A list of updates : {pathToData : newValue}.

Update the template with just the elements passed. All other binded values keep their state.
This method allows for real-time partial updates and is ideally suited to receive pushed notifications from the server.
```

### toHtml()

```
function Renderer#toHtml()
@return {String} The serialized HTML representation of the current template.
```

### destroy()

```
function Renderer#destroy()

Suppress a registered template, and free al lbinded elements.
Needed to fight the Zombie Templates syndrom.
