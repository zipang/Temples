CHANGELOG
----------------------


v0.1.1
[2012-10-25]
 * Added ChangeLog
 * Preparing to tag v0.1.1 before full rewriting

[2012-10-23]
 * corrected main location
 * Temples.render(data) will automatically register the whole document as template and render the full page with the provided data
 * First build of the minified version
 * strange shorter syntax improvement : $root.each(bindIterator).each(bind);

[2012-10-22]
 * Code reorganization + lots of comments
 * Remove the binding attributes once the binding is done. Results in cleaner output.
 * Fix : create a special kind of binding for elements that have only the render-data-if attribute
 * Renderer.parse() : Add the root element itself to the parsed elements set
 * Added conditional-rendering and data-each as a synonym to data-iterate
 * Iteration block alternate syntax

[2012-10-20]
 * fixed : $().val() instead of $().value(), String.prototype.startsWith() not present.
 * extractData() can now invoke methods on the provided objects. Useful for the plugins extension mechanism.
 * First commit
